  question1: {
    title: "How much of my grant goes to the charity I pick?",
    text:
      "100% goes to the charity you pick. TrueKarma will retain a Processing Fee (currently 10%, subject to change) from the total donation amount provided by a donor during the Grant process to cover credit card and ACH processing and associated bank fees as well as Website maintenance costs. The participating Charity understands that this donation is to be treated as 100% received by the Charity and then the Processing Fee is “paid” to TrueKarma as per the above."

  question2: {
    title: "What are the tax implications of my contributions?",
    text:
      "The tax deduction for those who itemize for security or mutual fund shares held for more than one year is generally the fair market value of the shares on the date of contribution. The deduction for shares held for one year or less is generally limited to the lower of cost basis or the fair market value on the date of contribution. Please consult your tax advisor for specifics on your own tax situation."
